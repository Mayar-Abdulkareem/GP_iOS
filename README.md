# GradPro

GradPro is an innovative iOS application designed to streamline the process of graduation project registration and management for students. It offers a platform where students can register their graduation projects, get matched with peers who have similar or opposite interests using machine learning, communicate with their supervisors, track their project progress, upload assignments, and view grades.

## Features

- **Project Registration**: Easy registration and management of graduation projects.
- **Peer Matching**: Machine learning algorithm to match students based on their interests for better collaboration.
- **Supervisor Communication**: A built-in messaging system to facilitate direct communication with supervisors.
- **Progress Tracking**: Students can track their project milestones and deadlines.
- **Assignment Upload**: A feature for submitting assignments and receiving feedback.
- **Grade Viewing**: Access to grades and evaluations for submitted work.

## Technical Stack

- **UIKit**: Used for creating a user-friendly interface.
- **MVVM**: Design pattern for structuring the app, separating the UI from the business logic.
- **Router Design Pattern**: for API calls and networking.
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Manages the app flow and screen presentation logic.
- **Machine Learning**: For intelligent matching of students based on project interests.
